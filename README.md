# Multi-Ticker Volatility Prediction
This project focuses on forecasting financial volatility across multiple tickers by combining traditional machine learning models with advanced deep learning architectures. The goal is to leverage both structured market data and unstructured sentiment signals to improve predictive performance in a multi-ticker time series setting.
## Project Overview
Financial markets are inherently dynamic, with volatility influenced by a mix of price movements, macroeconomic conditions, and market sentiment.
In this project, we:
- Built a supervised time series forecasting pipeline using multiple tickers.
- Incorporated sentiment features (FinBERT and KeyBERT-based) along with price, technical, and derived indicators.
- Applied lagged and rolling features per ticker to capture temporal dependencies.
- Benchmarked several models ranging from tree-based methods to deep learning architectures.
- Evaluate models using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ², and rank them using a combined ranking strategy.
